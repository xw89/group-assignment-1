randomwalk.py  is the code for Problem 1 and rwxn.pdf rwxn2.pdf and rwxn3.pdf are runouts of this code.

diffusion.py is the code for Prob 2.

diffusion_ani.py is the animation code of the diffusion process. diffusion.mp4 is the runout.

dla.py is a first code for Problem 3 and dla.pdf is runout.

dla_ani.py is the animation code for the growing process. 

P3_b is the code for fractional dimension extraction and mass_vs_R.pdf & fractional_dimension.pdf are the runout. Note Nmax need to be inctreased for better accuracy.

P3_c is the code for (c)--it runs the code of (b) 10 times and calculates the mean value and standard deviation for Df
	- Run on my computer I got: Df =  1.56 +/- 09  
	- Output is dla_0.pdf, dla_1.pdf, ... dla_9.pdf are the 10 cluster grown (four representative clusters were uploaded)

GP_Assignment_A_1st.tex is draft 1 of the latex document, combined with revsymb4-1.sty and revtex4-1.cls. GP_Assignment_A_1st.pdf is the generated pdf file.

GP_Assignment_A_2nd.tex is draft 2 of latex document. Problem 1 is finished.

GP_Assignment_A_Presentation.tex and associated files are the presentation. Problem 1 mostly done, 2 and 3 need more work.
